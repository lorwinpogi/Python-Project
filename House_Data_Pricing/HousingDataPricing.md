# Housing Data Pricing

The target variable in this housing dataset is typically referred to as MEDV, which stands for the Median Value of Owner-Occupied Homes, usually expressed in thousands of dollars. This value represents the central tendency of house prices within a specific area or neighborhood, providing a realistic estimate of housing market values. Understanding the distribution and factors influencing MEDV is crucial because it reflects both the economic conditions and the desirability of the location. The model aims to predict this median price based on key features such as the size of the home, socio-economic status of residents, and the age of the property, helping stakeholders like buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

The regression model uses three key features from the housing dataset to predict house prices. These features were chosen because they often have a strong relationship with housing value and provide a mix of structural and socio-economic indicators. Specifically, RM represents the average number of rooms per dwelling, which reflects the size and potential luxury of a house. LSTAT indicates the percentage of the population considered lower status, which often correlates negatively with housing prices due to socio-economic factors. Finally, AGE refers to the age of the property, capturing the effect of newer versus older homes on pricing.

- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling

- LSTAT: Percentage of lower status population in the area

- AGE: Age of the property (proportion of units built prior to 1940)
